      The Quran is the Muslim scripture, that is to say the scripture of the
      followers of Islam. <br />
      Islam is the religion established among the Arabs - a people until then
      largely confined <br />
      to the Arabian Peninsula - by the Prophet
      <b>Hazrat Muhammad (SAWW)</b> in the early seventh century. <br />
      The Quran was revealed to Prophet <b>Hazrat Muhammad (SAWW)</b> by
      <b>Allah</b> through the agency of the angel Gabriel; <br />
      this took place partly in Mecca, his hometown, and partly in Medina,
      where he succeeded <br />
      in creating a state in an otherwise stateless tribal society. The
      message was revealed in Arabic, <br />
      the language of the people it was initially addressed to, even though
      the message was ultimately <br />
      for the whole of humanity. The Quran specifically mentions that
      <b>Hazrat Muhammad (SAWW)</b> was the messenger <br />
      to the whole of mankind, and that he is the last messenger to be sent.
      Thus, the Quran <br />
      is the final message that supersedes and reiterates the basic religion
      God ordained for the Jews <br />
      and the Christians,as well as the Muslims. Today, the total number of
      Muslims in the world <br />
      is over a billion,making up almost a fifth of the worldâ€™s population.
      For all Muslim communities, <br />
      whatever their language and wherever they live, the Quran is their
      scripture.
